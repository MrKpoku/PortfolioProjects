PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project explores global COVID-19 data using SQL to uncover trends in deaths, vaccinations, and infection rates across countries and time periods. It demonstrates my ability to clean, transform, and analyze real-world datasets using advanced SQL techniques.

 OBJECTIVES
- Analyze global COVID-19 death rates and vaccination progress
- Identify countries with the highest and lowest death-to-case ratios
- Track vaccination rollouts over time
- Compare regional performance and highlight outliers
- Practice advanced SQL concepts including CTEs and window functions.

 TOOLS & TECHNIQUES
- SQL Server Management Studio 21
- GitHub for version control
- Tableau ( i will visualize further findings and share, Kindly watch this space)
- Excel (for data cleaning or exploration)

KEY INSIGHTS
- Primarily, a major key insight to herald is United States being the highest country with the number of deaths and how they quickly bounced back from their massive loss. It was truly remarkable.

  SQL CONCEPTS USED
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window Functions  (PARTITION BY)
- Aggregate Functions (SUM(), MAX())
- Joins (INNER)
- Data type conversions and filtering
